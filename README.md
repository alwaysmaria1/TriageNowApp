# TriageNow  ![HopStart 2025 2nd Place Winner](https://img.shields.io/badge/HopStart-2nd%20Place-brightgreen)

## Main Reason
In a mass casualty incident (MCI), first responders face overwhelming patient loads, outdated paper triage tags, and congested radio channels—factors that lead to delays, lost information, and, ultimately, loss of life. TriageNow was built by first responders for first responders to close these gaps, enabling rapid, accurate decision‑making when every second counts.
